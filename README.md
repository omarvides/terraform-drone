## Known issues

* DigitalOcean provider for terraform has a known issue where a domain cannot be created with an IP address, this is a problem for this module and any other because there is no way to only register a domain using terraform without having an already existing Droplet, this means that you cannot have a module that only creates a domain and other modules that create the VMs after the domain is created, it requires always to have a VM created to register a domain, so you will be able to use this module to create one and only one server in digital ocean of drone.io, if you try to use this module to create a second drone.io module with an already registered domain terraform will create your server but will fail to register you A record, this is out of my hands until this issue is resolved [Make ip_address optional for digitalocean_domain (as it is in DigitalOceanâ€™s API)](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-digitalocean/issues/112)
